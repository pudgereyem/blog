I came across the Kickstarter "soon-to-bee-founded-i-hope" project [Instaprint](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/breakfastny/instaprint-the-location-based-photo-booth-for-inst), which describes itself as **The location based photo booth for Instagram**.

> Instaprint is a location based photo booth that can transform parties and events by putting a camera in everyone's hand. By setting Instaprint to look out for specific locations or hashtags, any Instagram tagged appropriately will automatically be printed out on inkless paper. Get one for your next party, event, wedding, fiesta...

[Go to Instaprint's Kickstarter page](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/breakfastny/instaprint-the-location-based-photo-booth-for-inst) and read more about the awesome project.

Okay, so thats really cool. But what's even cooler is the guys behind Instaprint; [BREAKFAST](http://breakfastny.com/), and on their [Twitter Profile](https://twitter.com/#!/breakfastny), tells us that they:

> We create custom physical-digital goodies that connect the wonders of the web with the real world. A nice mix of design, web, robotics, and ol' fashion fun.

## Physical + Digital

The last week I've gotten my mind completly blown of several times about the awesomeness that can be done when doing both digital and physical. As for example, the guys developing Instraprint is also creating [instaprint.me](http://instaprint.me).

### List of awesome Physical + Digital projects:

- [Autonomus Agile Aerial Robots](http://blog.pudge.se/post/autonomous-agile-aerial-robots) - I mean c'mon, that title is just mad.
