[rdio]() is the new kid on the block when it comes to music streaming, and I got my invite just 3 days ago. Short story: **I like it!**

With a quite similar goal as [Spotify](), rdio strives to offer music to everyone, everwhere. Having used Spotify for some years now - which I really like - I still struggle with the same problem.

**I don't manage to find new music. I listen to same music over and over again.**

And that sucks. I tried to use Collaborative Playlists with friends, but it always, always ends up dead. Spotify's fault or mine, does not matter. Let's see if rdio can help me with that.

I also really like the slick web app they put out. **+1**
