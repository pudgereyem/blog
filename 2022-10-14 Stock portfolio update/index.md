### Summary

- Sold Amazon and bought Palantir
- Sold Nordea and bought Intel
- I currently sit with 60% in stocks and 40% in cash
- Aim to be fully invested over the eight coming months (5% each month)

### Nordea -> Intel

I really like Nordea as a dividend stock, but decided to transfer in Intel for the following reasons:

1. There is a shortage of semiconductors
2. Intel is building factories where semiconductors are made
3. Due to the political climate USA wants to have more control (on shore) of the production of semiconductors
4. Intel does pay a dividend
5. By owning both AMD, Intel and Nvidia I have really good coverage regardless which of the companies performs the best in the future

### Amazon -> Palantir

Nothing against Amazon, but due to political climate and the growing tension between USA and China I think the U.S Government could possibly partner up more with Palantir the coming months. Cynical and sad, I know.

### Buying the dip

Prices has come down and I've decided to buy the dip so to speak. In eight months I plan to be fully invested.
