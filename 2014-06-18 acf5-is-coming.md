[Elliot Condon](https://twitter.com/elliotcondon) – the author of [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) – is working on a new version (v5) of the oh-so-awesome ACF. There is no official release yet, but there is a [public beta](<(http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/acf5-public-beta-now-open/)>) released - which you can use.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AdvancedCustomFields&amp;src=hash">#AdvancedCustomFields</a> version 5 is almost ready for launch! Help find any remaining issues by using the beta today! <a href="https://t.co/PYivdGA4cV">https://t.co/PYivdGA4cV</a></p>&mdash; elliot condon (@elliotcondon) <a href="https://twitter.com/elliotcondon/statuses/445459654999437312">March 17, 2014</a></blockquote>

## What's new

Checkout Elliot's blog post about [what's coming in version 5 here](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/updates/whats-new-version-5/).  
Some things that you can look forward too:

- [+] No more "Add ons", instead there will be a "Pro" version.
- [+] Changed Database structure
- [+] Visual updates
- [+] Performance updates
- [+] New "Locations"
- [+] New "Fields"
- [+] "acf-json" _<- The bomb_
- [+] Added [WP-JS-Hooks](https://github.com/carldanley/wp-js-hooks)

## acf-json

The best update in my opinion is by far the "acf-json" addition, which stores your configuration (all the custom fields you created) in JSON – so these changes is synced when migrating between a local and a live server for example.

> Previously I had a file (acf-setup.php) that basically was the exported configuration of all the Advanced Custom Fields that I had setup. I also tried doing [automated exporting](http://seanbutze.com/automated-exporting-for-advanced-custom-fields/) for a while.

Now this will happen automatically. Wonderful!
